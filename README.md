First JavaScript project finished! It helped my comprehension of the lessons so much to actually execute in a project what was learned.

Most functions were written and tested smoothly, used a Math.random method and assigned a string value to corresponding thirds.  players selection comes from a window.prompt.  

My hang up came in the playGame() funciton, which required 5 rounds to be played.  I could play five rounds, but was required to call the function each time... which isn't the point.  I didn't think we had learned loops yet, maybe I missed it, but I felt like I should accomplish this task without using a loop (though I knew it was the easiest path to achieve the result I wanted.) 

In the end I looked up loops and added it to my playGame().  The function runs perfectly with the score being reported after each round and returns the winner/loser at the end of the 5 rounds.  Happy to have used the loop, as its the right way to do it.
